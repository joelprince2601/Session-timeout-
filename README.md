# Session Timeout Example

This repository contains an example implementation of session management with automatic expiration. It showcases how to manage session timeouts effectively in web applications using different technologies and frameworks.

## Features

- **Session Management**: Illustrates how to handle user sessions securely.
- **Automatic Timeout**: Implements session expiration mechanisms to log out users automatically after a specified period of inactivity.
- **Technology Stack**: Utilizes Java, Spring Boot, and possibly other frameworks to demonstrate session timeout handling.
- **Secure User Experience**: Ensures that user sessions are managed securely to protect sensitive data and maintain application integrity.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven (for building and running the Spring Boot application, if applicable)
- Dependencies specific to the chosen technology stack (e.g., Spring Security, Hibernate, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Running the Application

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory for your chosen implementation (e.g., `spring-boot`).
3. Build and run the application using the specific instructions provided in the README of that directory.

### Usage

- Follow the instructions in the respective directory (`spring-boot`, etc.) to understand how session timeouts are managed and implemented.
- Customize timeout settings and behavior as per your application's requirements.
- Test and verify session timeout functionalities in a controlled environment.

### Configuration

- Adjust session timeout duration and other configurations in the application properties or configuration files of your chosen framework.
- Ensure that session management settings comply with security best practices and application requirements.
